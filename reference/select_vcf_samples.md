# Subset VCF samples

Subsrt VCF samples by superpopulation.

## Usage

``` r
select_vcf_samples(
  superpopulation = NULL,
  samples = NULL,
  LD_reference = "1KGphase1",
  verbose = TRUE
)
```

## Arguments

- superpopulation:

  Superpopulation to subset LD panel by (used only if `LD_reference` is
  "1KGphase1" or "1KGphase3"). See
  [popDat_1KGphase1](https://rajlabmssm.github.io/echoLD/reference/popDat_1KGphase1.md)
  and
  [popDat_1KGphase3](https://rajlabmssm.github.io/echoLD/reference/popDat_1KGphase3.md)
  for full tables of their respective samples.

- samples:

  \[Optional\] Sample names to subset the VCF by. If this option is
  used, the
  [GRanges](https://rdrr.io/pkg/GenomicRanges/man/GRanges-class.html)
  object will be converted to a
  [ScanVcfParam](https://rdrr.io/pkg/VariantAnnotation/man/ScanVcfParam-class.html)
  for usage by
  [readVcf](https://rdrr.io/pkg/VariantAnnotation/man/readVcf-methods.html).

- LD_reference:

  LD reference to use:

  1KGphase1

  :   1000 Genomes Project Phase 1 (genome build: hg19).

  1KGphase3

  :   1000 Genomes Project Phase 3 (genome build: hg19).

  UKB

  :   Pre-computed LD from a British European-decent subset of UK
      Biobank. *Genome build* : hg19

  \<vcf_path\>

  :   User-supplied path to a custom VCF file to compute LD matrix
      from.\
      *Accepted formats*: *.vcf* / *.vcf.gz* / *.vcf.bgz*\
      *Genome build* : defined by user with `target_genome`.

  \<matrix_path\>

  :   User-supplied path to a pre-computed LD matrix. *Accepted
      formats*: *.rds* / *.rda* / *.csv* / *.tsv* / *.txt*\
      *Genome build* : defined by user with `target_genome`.

- verbose:

  Print messages.
